        <p>~Blacker than a moonless night, hotter and more bitter than hell itselfâ€¦ that is coffee..~<br>
        What can really be said about me? I'm just an ungodly cool guy with a mask. And I've come back from the dead and become a prosecutor... to do battle with the man who took everything from me.</p>
        <h2>My Rules</h2>
        <p class="myRules">
            1. If you're not ready yourself, then you shouldn't expect others to be.<br>
            2. Save the big questions for the testimony.<br>
            3. Always chase a riddle down to the end.<br>
            4. Don't let the mysteries of yesterday mystify you today (only losers think like that). You've got to change with the times!<br>
            5. When lied to, always down a mug of coffee.<br>
            6. You've got to strike while the iron is hot.<br>
            7. You can make your own rules.<br>
            8. Upon meeting a beautiful lady, always ask for her name and profession. (ask again if said lady turns out to be possessed by an evil spirit)<br>
            9. If you've got a problem, solve it during cross-examination.<br>
            10. If you've got a question, ask the witness.<br>
            11. If it's worth asking, ask the witness.<br>
            12. Never drink more than 17 cups of coffee during any given trial.<br>
